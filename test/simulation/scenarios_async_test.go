// TestA1AsyncResultDestruction reproduces async finding A1: in async dispatch
// the processor submits requests fire-and-forget with an in-memory pending
// map as the only record, and long-lived ResultBroadcasters pop results from
// the shared Redis result queue destructively. Kill the processor after
// submission: the pending map dies with it, the replacement starts fresh
// broadcasters with no subscribers, and when the results arrive they are
// popped and discarded. With the reconciler re-enqueueing in_progress
// orphans, the destruction manifests as duplicate spend: the discarded run
// is re-executed in full, so the engine serves every request twice. Without
// re-enqueue it manifested as a failed batch with no output.
//
// Violated invariant (work conservation): inference that was paid for and
// whose results were durably produced must not be silently destroyed —
// neither dropped outright nor re-bought via full re-execution.
